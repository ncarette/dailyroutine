It occurs in people whose immune defenses, for unknown reasons, destroy the cells in the pancreas that create insulin. Insulin is essential for humans: It allows the glucose in our blood to enter our cells and fuel our bodies. Consequently, diabetes can cause hypoglycemia, when there is not enough glucose in the blood, and hyperglycemia, when there is too much. These two phenomena, taken to extremes in duration or intensity, can cause serious complications, up to and including death. This constant danger for the diabetic translates into a constant mental burden, which often weighs on everyday life. This fiction proposes to illustrate it.</warning>","\n","^<strong><i>This story aims to raise awareness about the difficulties of managing type 1 diabetes, please keep in mind that the experience is not the same for everyone and that diabetes can be managed.</i></strong>","\n","ev","str","^<b>Start the story</b>","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-0","flg":20},{"c-0":["\n","^<chapter>Chapter 1: A Rough Start</chapter>","\n","^The alarm clock blares, jolting Zucchi from their slumber.
