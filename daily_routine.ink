<warning> <a href="https:\/\/www.verywellhealth.com/type-1-diabetes-overview-3289655" target="_blank">Type 1 diabetes</a> is a serious autoimmune chronic disease. It occurs in people whose immune defenses, for unknown reasons, destroy the cells in the pancreas that create insulin. Insulin is essential for humans: It allows the glucose in our blood to enter our cells and fuel our bodies. Consequently, diabetes can cause hypoglycemia, when there is not enough glucose in the blood, and hyperglycemia, when there is too much. These two phenomena, taken to extremes in duration or intensity, can cause serious complications, up to and including death. This constant danger for the diabetic translates into a constant mental burden, which often weighs on everyday life. This fiction proposes to illustrate it.</warning> 

<strong><i>This story aims to raise awareness about the difficulties of managing type 1 diabetes, please keep in mind that the experience is not the same for everyone and that diabetes can be managed.</i></strong>

<chapter>Chapter 1: A Rough Start</chapter>

The alarm clock blares, jolting Zucchi from their slumber. <a onclick="CreateDialogBox()">They</a> groggily reach over and silence it, rubbing the sleep from their eyes. As they sit up, they notice the dull ache of fatigue in their bones, a feeling that's all too familiar. They are living with type 1 diabetes, and they know that this is going to be another day of constant balancing.
    **[Get up !]

Zucchi reaches for their phone on the nightstand and looks at their blood sugar levels on the CGM app. 

<expl>A <a href="https:\/\/www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/managing-diabetes/continuous-glucose-monitoring" target="_blank">CGM</a> is a Continuous Glucose Monitor, a tiny sensor inserted under the skin that wirelessly displays every few minutes the blood glucose levels, also called blood sugar, thanks to a transmitter. It is then showed on a monitor that is often the user's own phone. The cost of a CGM is high and Swiss insurance companies only refund CGMs under certain restrictive conditions, not for all diabetics. </expl> 

It's a little low, they know that they need to eat something, but they're running late for work and don't have much time. They feel stressed and frustrated.
    ***[So, what about breakfast?] -> Breakfast


/* **********************Sub-chapter 2: breakfast************************* */

===Breakfast===

Zucchi contemplates their breakfast options. A bowl of cereal sounds tempting, but they know that it would cause their blood sugar levels to spike. Making something healthier, like scrambled eggs and spinach, would take too much time, and they're already running late for work. Skipping breakfast altogether, would cause their blood sugar levels to drop later in the morning.

<subchapter>What will Zucchi do for breakfast?</subchapter>

=breakfast_low_carb
~ time += 3
Zucchi takes the time to make a healthy breakfast, opting for scrambled eggs and spinach. The savory aroma of the eggs wafts through the kitchen, making Zucchi's stomach grumble with hunger. As they eat, they feel a sense of satisfaction knowing that they are making a good choice for their health. However, as they check the time, they realize that they are running late for work. Their heart races with anxiety and frustration, knowing that they have to choose between their health and punctuality. They feel a sense of guilt as they continue to prepare for this day, determined to make it to work on time.

=breakfast_cereal
~ time += 1
Zucchi pours a bowl of cereal, the colorful and crunchy cereal pieces look inviting. As they pour the milk and add the sugar, the sweet aroma of the cereal fills the room. As they take the first bite, the sweetness and crunchy texture of the cereal is satisfying. However, as they finish the bowl, they start to feel sluggish and heavy. They check their blood sugar level, it's high. They realize that the cereal has caused their blood sugar levels to spike. They have to take more insulin than they planned and they have to constantly monitor their blood sugar. They feel guilty and frustrated about not making healthier choices. They're running late for work now and feel stressed.

<expl> Type 1 diabetics must take <a href="https:\/\/www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/insulin-medicines-treatments" target="_blank">insulin</a> because their pancreas does not make it on its own. They need to take insulin several times during the day, including when they eat and drink, to control their blood glucose level. There are different ways to take insulin. They can use a needle and syringe, an insulin pen, or an insulin pump. Pump and pens are more expensive, but are refunded by Swiss insurance companies.</expl>
    *[Ok.]-> Finalbreakfast

=breakfast_skip
~ breakfastskip = true
Zucchi skips breakfast altogether feeling the pressure of time and the stress of being late for work. They quickly check their blood sugar level and it's dangerously low. They feel lightheaded, anxious, and unsure of what to do next. Their stomach growls with hunger, and they feel weak. The thought of dealing with hypoglycemia during work fills them with dread and guilt. They know that skipping breakfast has consequences on their blood sugar level, and they must make a decision on how to address it.

<subchapter>How will Zucchi address their low blood sugar?</subchapter>

            ~ time += 2
            
            Zucchi takes the time to check their blood sugar level with the glucometer and carefully calculates the right amount of sugar they need. They feel a sense of relief as they take the sugar, knowing that they have addressed their low blood sugar level. However, as they check the time, they realize that they are running very late for work. They feel stressed and frustrated about having to make a choice between their health and punctuality.

===Finalbreakfast===
Breakfast is a crucial part of managing diabetes, but it can also be a source of stress and frustration, especially when time is a factor. Zucchi has to balance the need to eat a healthy breakfast with the reality of their busy schedule, and this can be a difficult task, with consequences. In their daily routine, Zucchi always needs to make choices and experience the consequences of those choices, which may or may not take up a lot of mental space.

*[Now, it is time to pack]
    -> Packing


/* **********************Sub-chapter 3: packing ************************* */

===Packing===

Zucchi starts to get ready for the day, but before leaving the house, they need to start packing their diabetes supplies. They have to make sure they have enough insulin for the day with them, in case of hyperglycemia or if they need to eat, but also enough glucose, in case of hypoglycemia, like soda, glucose tablets, or everything that has a big concentration of glucose while being easily ingested and transportable. 
    *[Oh]

They should check their insulin in the refrigerator and make sure they have enough for the next couple of days, because soon is the week-end, and the pharmacy will be closed. They feel anxious and stressed about the possibility of running out of insulin or glucose during the day or following days.They are always worried they'll forget something important, so they double check everything.

~ time += 1
Zucchi brings extra glucose tablets, just in case. They feel relieved but also frustrated that they have to think about things like this just to leave the house. They feel depressed at the thought of potentially having to eat the glucose tablets again in case of hypoglycemia. Over time, it has really become disgusting.

=pack_rushed
~ packrushed = true
Zucchi quickly packs some sugar without checking the insulin pens. They don't check their CGM and don't realize it's not working properly. This sure will lead to a stressful day, where they have to constantly check with a glucometer and don't feel as free.

/* **********************Sub-chapter 4: checking CGM ************************* */

===checking_cgm===
~ time += 1
Zucchi checks their glucose sensor, making sure it's working properly and that their phone has enough battery. They know that this device is critical for managing their diabetes, but when it's not working properly, it can be a stressful and overwhelming experience. They feel relieved when it's working well but also a bit frustrated if it's not working because it means a day without a CGM and having to check blood sugar levels manually with a glucometer.

*[Check]
{~->not_working|->not_working|->working}

==not_working==

Unfortunately, the sensor is not working. Zucchi's phone is charged, but the blood glucose values are on standby and they don't know when or how the CGM will work again.

<subchapter>What will Zucchi do about that?</subchapter>

*[Contact the hotline for the sensor's manufacturer] -> contact_hotline

    =contact_hotline
    ~ time += 2
    Zucchi contacts the hotline for the sensor's manufacturer. After some long minutes on the phone, the operator finds the solution to make the sensor work again. Zucchi feels relieved that they got help, but also frustrated by the wait time. 
    *[Humph]
        -> final_packing
    
    =no_cgm
    Zucchi decide to spend the day without the CGM. They feel less free, more stressed and anxious, having to check the sugar manually with a glucometer.

    ~ time += 1
    Zucchi check the sugar with a glucometer, it is not as convenient as the CGM, but it allows Zucchi to still have a sense of their blood sugar level and make necessary adjustments. They feel relieved but also frustrated at the inconvenience of having to use a manual method.

Fortunately, the sensor works. Zucchi feels relieved, but they know that the opposite situation has happened so often. The weight of these uncertainties and the impact on their health and schedule are too great to be forgotten. 
    *[Humph]
-> final_packing

==final_packing==
All these tasks and decisions, which may seem small, add up to a big and overwhelming burden for Zucchi. From packing diabetes supplies, to checking insulin pens, to dealing with malfunctioning equipment, managing diabetes is a full-time job that never stops. Zucchi feels overwhelmed and stressed about the constant need to make sure they have enough supplies, and the possibility of having to go without a critical device like a CGM, but they are determined to keep going.

===Dress===

Zucchi has to decide on what to wear, thinking about the weather and their activity level, to make sure they're dressed properly and wear comfortable clothes to wear their CGM. They have to make sure their clothes have pockets, where they can keep the glucose tablets and their CGM. They also have to make sure their clothes are loose enough to allow them to quickly and discreetly take their insulin shots. They feel overwhelmed, resentful, and frustrated that they have to think about so many things, just to go to work.
